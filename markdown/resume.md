Computer Science and Engineering, B.E.
Fall 2004 - Summer 2010
R.V. College of Engineering, Bangalore (India)


## Proficiency

### Technologies & Languages

Java, Go, Groovy, Python, Shell Scripting, MySQL, MongoDB, Schema matching and Record linkage techniques, MVC and Agile software development.

### Cloud environment experience

* Google cloud platform and Amazon web services

### Frameworks

* Netty, Grails, Spring MVC, Dropwizard, Servlet programming and REST API design.
* Open source contributions to Apache Mesos, Apache Spark and TokuMX (Fractal tree based fork of MongoDB).

## Experience

### Brightcove Inc, Seattle, WA `[June 2010 to Present]`

#### Staff Engineer, Reporting and Analytics

* Lead modernization and container native development methodologies working group.
    * Developed a strategy for development and deployment of microservices platform using Kubernetes.
    * Provide mentorship and guidance to engineering teams on best-practices for building resilient services.
    * Implemented SRE practices and procedures for multiple products.
* Architected and implemented multiple core subsystems of a distributed system that handles time-series data aggregation, storage and query/visualization:
    * The system started form 18,000 qps and currently handles over 12 billion events every day.
    * Implemented using netty, java, Apache Beam, Google cloud Bigtable, Kubernetes and other GCP services.
    * Collaborated closely with multiple teams at Google Cloud to provide insight into high performance product features

#### Sr. Software Engineer, Reporting and Analytics

Worked as an engineer in the data analytics team at Brightcove that provides products for users (both internal and external to the organization) that allows them to generate data backed insights into user behavior.

* Design and development of large scale real time data processing pipeline for deep-dive (OLAP) analytics querying.
* Involved in interacting with users to gain insights to understand their perspective use cases and implementing resulting insights.
* Design and development of tools and methodologies to allow for seamless deployment, monitoring and maintenance of services in a microservices environment based on Apache Mesos.
* Development of a system that "translates" data analytics results into human friendly insights for users.

#### Software Engineer, Ingestion and custom workflows

Worked as a part of a team involved in building an end-to-end cloud based service which allows users to specify complex workflows for video content using a JSON based DSL.

* Built REST API to allow users to manage their workflows and to worker nodes to fetch next job to process.
* Service to enable job prioritization to handle Job starvation and performs priority escalation based on user defined rules.
* HTML5/Javascript client side application development.

#### Software Engineer, Distribution and Syndication

I was part of a team that manages the distribution and syndication product at Brightcove. This project dealt with the problem of enabling customers to be able to keep all their videos in sync on different 3rd party endpoints (such as youtube, google video sitemaps, FTP, etc).

* Pluggable queueing system to manage user job fairness ( based on historical usage or round robin ).
* High availability using hot backups and MySQL backing store.
* REST API to manage syncing end points and report status.
* Ability of increase capacity elastically to arbitrary limits based on service load.
* Capable of serving more than 200 requests/second using a single orchestrator server. (Actual capacity varies based on bandwidth and worker node limitations).
* Technologies used:  MySQL, Spring MVC (Java) application server and Apache Zookeeper (for distributed synchronization and coordination).

#### Deployment automation and management system

* Design and development of infrastructure for push-button deployment of distributed applications in a cloud-computing environment.
* Design and development for a scalable service monitoring and configuration service to manage hundreds of nodes using a single administration console.
* Technologies used included but not limited to Java, Spring framework, Zookeeper, MongoDB, Amazon EC2.



#### Software Engineer, Read/Write Scalability

I worked on the Read/Write scalability team as an engineer working on the caching layer

* Design and development of a multi-node caching solution for video metadata for served media content.
* Design and developed TV everywhere solution to allow DRM/Protected access to video access.
* Development of rules based access and media sharing solution for video content.


### rewardtag.com and unistr.com, Mountain View, CA `[September 2010 to Present]`

#### Chief Technology Officer and Co-founder

I take all technology decision and drive the design and development of the product from an engineering standpoint. The product is a simple sticker that a user can put on their device. This sticker has a unique ID, in case of a lost device, the finder can enter this number on the website and get a reward for returning it to the owner.

* Design, development and maintenance of the webapp.
* Requirement elicitation from business partners and establishing the technology vision of the product.
* Development of an enterprise solution for centralized management of assets.
* Featured in many media articles, blogs (such as gizmodo) and soon to be implemented with Logitech Ultimate Ears.

### USCLab, University of Southern California, Los Angeles `[July 2009 to May 2010]`

#### Graduate Assistant

Worked as a network administrator and student developer with the radio-oceanography lab.

* Helped in creating scripts and programs to perform data analysis of water samples from the undersea robots.
* Built and maintained cluster using Eucalyptus private cloud management system.
* Built web service to allow for easy manipulation and access of scientific data.

### Yahoo! Research and Development, Bangalore (India) `[Spring 2008]`

#### Intern

* Worked with the Small Business team http://in.business.yahoo.com. Proposed design increased scalability and the revenue of the project 2-3 times in the months following the launch of the service.
* Designed, proposed and implemented backend and frontend of the project. [PHP, JAVA and C++]

## Academic Projects

### RAYS - Server infrastructure for live video content `[January 2010 to May 2010]`

#### University of Southern California

* Designed, implementation and researched a system that enables large-scale video streaming and storage for on the go for wearable cameras and mobile devices. [C/C++, Python, Java, Javascript].
